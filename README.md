# tensorflow_tutorials

This repo stores TensorFlow learning materials I've studied on. The primary purpose of going through these jupyter notebooks is to get to know how the TensorFlow codes are used in practice and investigate them thoroughly. I hope I could show my interest in ML/DL through this repo :)
