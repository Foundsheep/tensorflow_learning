        "- Eager execution doesn't use `tf.Graph`, and could be understood as a normal python function with TensorFlow operations in it. But `tf.function` uses `tf.Graph` module(?) and it allows the function to speed up and efficiently deploy its operations with tensors.\n",
        "- `tf.function` applies to a function *and all other functions it calls*\n",
        "- To make a python function a `Function`, either I could decorate it when it is defined with `@tf.function` above the `def` line, or call it in `tf.function()` method and make a new variable, which results in a `Fucntion`.\n",
        "- When python grammars are included in `tf.function`, `tf.autograph` library inside automatically converts them to use a graph.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: one `Function`, many graphs... The number of graphs depends on inputs' dtypes and shapes.\n",
        "- `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)` can make `Fucntion` not to use a graph and operates eagerly.\n",
        "- When `Function` is operated, tracing is being done and it captures TF operations in a graph, but some python operations like `print` are not captured. To print values in both eager and graph execution, use `tf.print` instead"
